 Introduction:
===============
 Although Mandelbrot set has a simple definition it makes fascinating fractal.
It also has a relationship with julia sets, where it contains all constants that
julia sets are continuous.

 When I was a student of software engineering, I worte a Mandelbrout explorer in
C#. In this project I re-wrote another Mandelbrot and an implementation of julia
sets in Python.
